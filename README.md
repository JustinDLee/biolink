Biolink: A database of networked biological knowledge

The goal of biolink is to create a multi-model database to support queries on biological knowledge in the domains of genes, proteins, diseases, clinical trials, pathways, functional annotations (GO), bioassays, and compounds (Pubchem). Biolink can also serve as a nomenclature translation service.

### Links

- Check out the [API Documentation](./doc/api/endpoints.md) for how to use the API
- Read the [Progress Report](./docs/Biolink.pdf) for a comprehensive review of the progess we've made so far, and our goals for next steps
- See the [process documentation](./docs/process.md) for a less formal, more detailed account of the work we've done.

### Installation & Setup (Coming Soon)
We're working to make an easily configurable set up process, one that also helps with creating the neo4j database as well.


Current stack: Neo4J, Python (Flask), ReactJS
