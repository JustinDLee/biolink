Biolink: A database of networked biological knowledge

The goal of biolink is to create a multi-model database to support queries on biological knowledge in the domains of genes, proteins, diseases, clinical trials, pathways, functional annotations (GO), bioassays, and compounds (Pubchem). Biolink can also serve as a nomenclature translation service.
